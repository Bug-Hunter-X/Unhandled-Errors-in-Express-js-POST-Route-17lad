# Express.js Unhandled Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling in request processing.  The `bug.js` file showcases a POST route that lacks proper checks for empty or invalid request bodies, which can lead to application crashes or unexpected behavior. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

## Bug

The bug lies within the `/users` POST route.  It directly attempts to process `req.body` without checking if it's valid or contains the necessary data. If the request body is empty or malformed, the application will either crash or return a generic 500 error, giving little insight into the cause of the failure.

## Solution

The solution demonstrates how to handle potential errors and provide informative responses:

1. **Input Validation:** Validate the incoming request body to ensure it's not empty and contains the necessary fields.
2. **Error Handling:** Use `try...catch` blocks to gracefully handle errors that occur during database operations.
3. **Informative Responses:** Return specific HTTP status codes and error messages that provide context to the client.

This example highlights the importance of meticulous error handling for building robust and reliable Express.js applications.
